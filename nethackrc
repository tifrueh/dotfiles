# MENUCOLORS ===================================================================
# (https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Menucolors)
#
# Menucolors is a feature in NetHack 3.6 and above that allows you to colorize
# individual rows on a menu based on what regular expressions match its text.
# You can color the inventory menu, the spellcasting menu, the enhance menu,
# the options menu, and more.
# 
# For example, you could color all blessed items bright cyan, all cursed items
# bright orange, and all uncursed items dim green. From there you could
# underline dangerous items (loadstone, wand of cancellation, etc.), make the
# Amulet of Yendor magenta, all gold yellow, and so on, until you're satisfied.
