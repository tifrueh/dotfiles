# (https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Menucolors)

# Menucolors is a feature in NetHack 3.6 and above that allows you to colorize
# individual rows on a menu based on what regular expressions match its text.

# the options menu, and more.
# 
# For example, you could color all blessed items bright cyan, all cursed items

# Amulet of Yendor magenta, all gold yellow, and so on, until you're satisfied.
