# The color of the kitty windowâ€™s titlebar on macOS. A value of system means to
# use the default system color, light or dark can also be used to set it
# explicitly. A value of background means to use the background color of the
# currently active window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as
# #12af59 or red. WARNING: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary
# color (or background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it.
# It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the titlebar
# transparent. As such it is incompatible with background_opacity. If you want
# to use both, you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with
# hide_window_decorations.
