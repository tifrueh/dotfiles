# The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names. The
# special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout will be used as
# the startup layout. Default configuration is all layouts in alphabetical
# order. See https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#opt-kitty.enabled_layouts.

# The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the window
# border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
# horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values
# set top, right, bottom and left.

# The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when using
# powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled, slanted, round.

# The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where one is
# opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if supported by the
# OS (for instance, when using a compositor under X11). Note that it only sets
# the background colorâ€™s opacity in cells that have the same background color
# as the default terminal background, so that things like the status bar in
# vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a
# color theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be rendered
# as transparent. Instead you should change the default background color in
# your kitty config and not use a background color in the editor color scheme.
# Or use the escape codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script
# to launch your editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
# (possibly significant) performance hit. When using a low value for this
# setting, it is desirable that you set the background color to a color the
# matches the general color of the desktop background, for best text rendering.
# If you want to dynamically change transparency of windows, set
# dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it has a
# performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the config will only
# work if dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.
background_opacity 0.8

# Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the visuals
# behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it. Only takes effect
# when background_opacity is less than one. On macOS, this will also control
# the blur radius (amount of blurring). Setting it to too high a value will
# cause severe performance issues and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values
# up to 64 work well. Note that this might cause performance issues, depending
# on how the platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
# macOS and KDE under X11.
background_blur 2

# Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with yes. On
# macOS, titlebar-only and titlebar-and-corners can be used to only hide the
# titlebar and the rounded corners. Whether this works and exactly what effect
# it has depends on the window manager/operating system. Note that the effects
# of changing this option when reloading config are undefined. When using
# titlebar-only, it is useful to also set window_margin_width and
# placement_strategy to prevent the rounded corners from clipping text. Or use
# titlebar-and-corners.
