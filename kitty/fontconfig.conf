# You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic variants. To
# get a full list of supported fonts use the kitty +list-fonts command. By
# default they are derived automatically, by the OSes font system. When
# bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to auto on macOS, the priority of bold
# fonts is semi-bold, bold, heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font
# families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc.
